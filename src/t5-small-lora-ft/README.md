# Model Card for Model ID

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->
Small variant of the T5 model that has been fine-tuned on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset using LoRA.



## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->



- **Developed by:** Sri Hari Karthick
- **Model type:** SequenceToSequence
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **License:** MIT
- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** T5-small

### Model Sources [optional]

<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->

- **Repository:** https://github.com/codebykarthick/summarisation-fine-tuning

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->
For summarisation of internet body paragraphs, with a limit of 512 tokens and outputs a summary with a maximum length of 128 tokens.

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

Used for summarisation of text provided.

### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->

May not capture all content accurately, primarily fine-tuned on English language.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

[More Information Needed]

### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

Users (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.
